HiFiMan is known for planar magnetic headphones that live closer to the audiophile world than the usual gaming aisle, so a collaboration like this suggests ASUS is trying to build something that is meant to sound genuinely good, not just “gaming good”. The result is the ROG <a href=\"https://geni.us/pyFBBE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kithara</a>, a wired headset that sits in a price bracket where you stop judging it as an accessory and start judging it as proper audio equipment. At $459, it is not cheap, but it is also not trying to compete with mainstream gaming headsets on gimmicks. It is trying to compete on sound, build, and flexibility.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"390\" style=\"width: 696px; height: 390px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/akW_lv3-seM\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p data-start=\"405\" data-end=\"899\">The unboxing leans into that premium feel straight away. Inside, one detail I did not expect to see in a gaming product is a custom sound signature certificate, showing the frequency response curve. It looks relatively flat overall, with a gentle rise in the high end, which usually points towards a cleaner, more detailed tuning rather than a bass-heavy, instantly hyped sound.</p>\n<p data-start=\"901\" data-end=\"1706\">The Kithara’s accessory and cable system is where it starts to feel genuinely serious. You get the headset, a removable microphone, and multiple cable and connector options, including USB Type-C via a dongle. The way the cable locks into place is also reassuring. You line it up, twist it, and it clicks in securely, so it does not feel like something that will come loose mid-session. What I like here is that many of the connector options are designed to be direct, rather than stacking adapters on adapters. Depending on what you are plugging into, you can go from standard outputs to a more proper “audiophile” style connection without it feeling fiddly. One practical caveat is that microphone support depends on the cable setup, so you cannot assume every connection method carries mic the same way.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2051\" data-end=\"2589\">Build-wise, the Kithara feels solid and noticeably metallic. It also feels heavy. The earcups are large and fully cover the ears, and ASUS includes two sets of pads, one softer velour-style and one thicker leather-style, so you can pick what suits you. The headband adjustment uses a click-based system with multiple positions and feels sturdy, though I found myself needing to go lower than expected. Comfort will ultimately come down to how you handle the weight over longer sessions, because you feel it immediately when you put it on.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.1.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.2.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.4.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.5.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.6.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.7.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.8.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.9.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p data-start=\"2591\" data-end=\"3331\">The big reason this headset exists, though, is the planar magnetic driver design. Most gaming headsets use dynamic drivers that behave like a cone pushing sound from a central point. Planar magnetic drivers spread that movement across a flat diaphragm, which often translates into cleaner sound, better separation, and more precise detail. It is not automatically “better for everyone”, because dynamic drivers often give more of that bass slam, while planar tends to be tight and controlled rather than boomy. ASUS quotes a very wide frequency response range, from 8 Hz up to 55,000 Hz, and while the extremes are more of a spec flex than something you literally hear, it signals that this is built like a serious audio product, not a toy.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3333\" data-end=\"3670\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">On paper, the ROG Kithara is a headset you pick on purpose. It is premium, wired, heavy, and packed with connector flexibility, and it is betting that planar clarity and separation will win you over in both games and music. Next, I set it up across different sources and actually lived with it, and that is where the real verdict starts.</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">First up, comfort and fit over time. You definitely feel the weight here, not enough to hurt, but enough that you never forget it’s on your head. But other than that, the headset is spacious and it does not crush your ears. What surprised me more was the adjustment behaviour, the design had me re-adjusting it multiple times a day. If I pick it up by the headband, the weight can make the setting shift slightly, so when I put it back on it’s just not sitting exactly where it was. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.15.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.15-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.16.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.16-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.17.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.17-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.18.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.18-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.19.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.19-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.20.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.20-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.21.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.21-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.22.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.22-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.23.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.23-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.24.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.24-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.25.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.25-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This also affected how I handled it day to day. Because it’s heavier, it is genuinely hard not to place it down a bit too aggressively than I meant to, especially when I’m switching tasks or getting up from the desk. After a while I caught myself and started placing it down more carefully, but the weight is something I noticed every single day. If you’re coming from lighter headphones, there’s definitely a short adjustment period where you have to re-learn how you move with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Initially one side also felt a bit looser when adjusting. Luckily, I was able to improve that by tightening the screw. But it still didn’t fix the stability issues - if I lean forward at my desk, it doesn’t always stay put, a couple of times I genuinely had to catch it before it slipped off.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Let’s talk about the open back feature.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In a quiet room it is great, but in a shared room everyone is going to hear what you are doing.  If there is background noise around you, you are going to hear that too, so it is not a headset that ignores your environment.  For me the best use case is at home, desk based, quiet environment, where it can actually do its thing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sound wise, what became more obvious over time is the way it stays clean when the mix gets busy. Vocals in particular are consistently impressive and they sit forward in a really natural way. The trade off is if you are coming from dynamic headphones, you may notice less of that rumble on certain instruments. For example, on guitar strums my Sennheiser HD 58s have a bit more vibration and that lingering feel like the guitar is right there in my ear. The Kithara feels more controlled, open and crisp.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When it comes to connectors, I tested four setups: balanced 4.4mm into a proper source, unbalanced standard outputs, the dual 3.5mm PC cable for audio plus mic, and the USB C adapter. The differences were real but subtle, and most of it came down to how good the source is, not the connector doing magic.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The best sound I got was using my Sound Blaster X5 with the 4.4mm balanced connection, mainly because the X5 has more power and is just a higher quality DAC, so everything feels more effortless with a bit more headroom. The USB C option was closer than I expected, and for laptop or on-the-go use the sound is still solid, you just lose that last bit of “easy drive” a good DAC gives you.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Unbalanced works everywhere but is the most device dependent, so weaker jacks need more volume and can feel less confident. The dual 3.5mm cable is the simplest PC gaming mode because you get clean mic support and a straightforward desktop setup.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One thing I’ve appreciated more over time is how ASUS has basically future proofed the Kithara with the accessories. You get multiple cable options depending on how you run your audio, and because the cable is detachable with proper connectors, it’s the kind of thing you can actually replace when it eventually wears out instead of binning the whole headset.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.26.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.26-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.27.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.27-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.28.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.28-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.29.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.29-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.30.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.30-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.31.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/147/gallery/Still-2026-02-13-134001_1.97.31-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The extra ear pads matter too, because it lets you tune the comfort and the seal depending on what you prefer, and it also means you have a backup set ready to go if the originals get worn down. For me, the stock leatherette pads have been the clear winner, they don’t press on my head even after hours of use and they stay surprisingly cool, which is not something I can say about most pads in this style.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I’m not a fan of the velour set here, they feel hotter and the material just doesn’t feel as nice on skin. It might sound like a small thing, but this is the difference between a headset you can keep comfortably in rotation for years and one that gets sidelined the moment a pad or cable starts to fail.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-size: inherit;\" data-contrast=\"auto\">So after a few weeks with it, the Kithara feels like a headset you pick on purpose. I kept reaching for it when I wanted that open, detailed presentation and the clean planar separation, while still having a proper headset setup when I needed it, even if the giant top band gives it a bit of a Halo energy like I’m about to respawn in ranked, the strengths are big enough that I kept choosing it, you just need the right environment and a minute to dial in the fit. It does leak sound and it’s got some real weight to it, but if you’re using it at a desk in a quieter space, those trade-offs are easy to live with for what you get back in clarity and separation.</span><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What do you think?</span></p>\n<p data-start=\"3333\" data-end=\"3670\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"> </p>\n<p> </p>",

We ran a few quick gaming tests to see how it stacks up against the previous best chip, the 9800X3D. As expected, the gains are there, but they are small and very resolution dependent.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In Horizon Zero Dawn, we see around a 3 to 4 percent uplift in average FPS and also in the 1 percent lows. That is real performance, but it mainly shows up at lower resolutions where the CPU still has room to stretch its legs.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once we move to 4K, the picture becomes very clear. There is effectively no difference at all, because the GPU is the bottleneck. For reference, we are using an RTX 4090 here.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the difference is under 1 percent across all three tested resolutions. The reason for this is fairly simple. The game is already GPU-limited, even at 1080p, and the CPU is not running flat out. The processor is spending a lot of time waiting on the GPU to finish rendering frames, so increasing CPU clock speed does not translate into higher frame rates.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.3.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.1.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.2.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.5.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.4.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.6.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yes, with a faster GPU you could squeeze out slightly bigger differences in some titles, but we are now in a strange place in PC gaming. What we already have is good enough. Unless there is a major shift in how games are built or how workloads are split between CPU and GPU, there is very little reason to chase more CPU performance without a much faster graphics card to go with it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Some of this is already changing with technologies like upscaling and frame generation. Those do increase CPU workload slightly, but even then, the gains from a faster CPU are marginal if you already own a high-end X3D chip.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">That is still not the main reason I would tell most people to hold off on this CPU. The real problem is platform cost.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you already have an AM5 system and you are just swapping CPUs, then this is easy to recommend. As long as you can find it close to MSRP, this is simply the best gaming CPU you can buy right now.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">But if you are coming from another platform, the upgrade becomes expensive very quickly. You are not just buying a CPU. You are buying an AM5 motherboard and DDR5 memory, both of which are still priced higher than they should be. That is where this upgrade starts to hurt.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The worst part is that this is unlikely to change any time soon. There are no major platform shifts on the horizon, and without strong competition pushing prices down, motherboards and memory are not getting significantly cheaper.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.13.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.13-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.7.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.8.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.9.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.10.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.11.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.12.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/146/gallery/Still-2026-01-29-145350_1.28.12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So to wrap things up, this might sound like a slightly harsh take on the launch. The Ryzen 7 9850X3D is absolutely the best gaming CPU available today. It benefits from excellent 3D V-Cache design, higher clocks, and very strong efficiency. It just exists in a PC market that makes it hard to recommend unless you are already on AM5.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What do you think?

Here in Singapore it seems it will retail for over 700 Singapore dollars! But what you get for that is pretty cool though.</p>\n<p>This is a big router and that is pretty obvious by the box size. Inside we find the usual paperwork with a quick start guide, and the router itself. This router is of a flat wide design and can actually be wall mounted using the two points underneath. At the back it has two USB ports with one of them being USB 3.2. There are four Gigabit LAN ports, single 2.5 Gigabit WAN and a single 2.5 Gigabit LAN port.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately you are not able to convert one of the LAN ports to WAN and use two 2.5 Gigabit ports for your LAN, this would be a cool way to connect your high-end PC and NAS without getting a separate switch.

Antennas on this router are really large and they connect to all four corners. I feel this is where ASUS has missed an opportunity. You see these antennas have a little red panels - this could have been a perfect spot for an extra bit of RGB, especially for animations, but unfortunately it is just a little plastic insert.</p>\n<p>Once fully assembled it certainly looks large and as always pretty futuristic. Personally I prefer a more subtle design but, hey, it is ROG after all.

ASUS has actually labelled them up as levels. First level is the Gaming Port - it is a physical port on the router which will have its traffic prioritised over others (this is useful for plugging in your PC or console).</p>\n<p>Level two is Game Boost which enables adaptive QoS (also known as Quality of Service) to prioritise gaming traffic coming through the router in particular.</p>\n<p>Level three is Game Server Acceleration which is done by a third party service called Outfox. This service works to improve latency to the game server by choosing the most optimum path. I’ve used something similar here in Singapore before and did not have any improvement due to physical distance to all the servers for the games I play. Your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>Some other gaming features include wireless gaming mode which helps prioritising up to 4 phones or tablets, OPEN Nat for enabling specific port forwarding for games. As well as VPN fusion, which is actually one of my favourite tools.</p>\n<p>Another tool I like is multiple guest network set-ups. These actually have the ability to restrict your Intranet access. So you could have your secure devices connected to the main network, then create a separate network for your IOT devices which would only have Internet access and then create another guest network for your visitors.</p>\n<p>Personally I would have liked this to have VLAN support for proper network segmentation but for a prosumer device which will be used at home, this is good enough.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-01.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-01-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-02.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-02-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-03.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-03-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-04.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-04-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-05.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-05-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-06.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-06-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-07.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-07-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-08.png\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/111/gallery/asus-g04-08-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>This router also supports ASUS AiMesh technology so if you have or will purchase another supported router - you could create a mesh network which would work either over your wired network or over WiFi and you can keep adding nodes over time.</p>\n<p>The less gaming but general quality of life features include monitoring and security tools such as traffic analyser and AiProtection PRO.

So after using this mouse for over two months, here’s how it’s held up. </p>\n<p>The very first time I pulled it out of the box, it felt like something was missing, almost like when you pick up a TV remote that doesn’t have batteries in it. That weightless feeling took me a while to adjust to. But now that muscle memory has kicked in, it actually feels great in the hand. </p>\n<p>The surface has this matte texture that almost feels a bit rubbery, but it isn’t. ASUS calls it biobased nylon. As you can see here - after a couple of months, it no longer looks brand new, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s worn in and it feels really natural to use. </p>\n<p>One of the things I really like is that you don’t need to download any bloated software. Everything is done through a browser. From there you can set up profiles, remap buttons, adjust DPI from 100 all the way up to 42,000, change polling rate up to 8,000 Hz, play around with angle snapping, motion sync, lighting effects, and even set battery modes. It’s clean, straightforward, and Armory Crate is not required. </p>\n<p>Performance-wise, it tracks really well even on a cheap mousepad. I’ve never once felt like the mouse was letting me down. If I miss a shot, that’s all on me. It even has track-on-glass technology, which is a nice touch if you don’t always use a pad. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g01-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Battery life has been solid. I’m getting about three to four weeks on a charge with moderate use. When it’s low, it blinks red for a couple of days, and then you just plug in USB-C and you’re good again. </p>\n<p>The wireless dongle connection can get a bit flaky if it’s tucked behind too many things, but with a clear line of sight it’s been completely fine. And of course, you also have Bluetooth and wired modes if you prefer. In my example if I have it below my desk and have keyboard in the way, it can sometimes cut out so I tend to move the dongle under the desk but closer to mouse area with extension.  </p>\n<p>I did test both 1,000 Hz and 8,000 Hz polling rates, but honestly, I don’t really feel a big difference. Maybe if you’re a pro gamer you’ll notice it, but for me it was just nice to know the option is there. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g02-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The one thing I really wish this mouse had is tilt clicks on the scroll wheel.

The included grip stickers are a nice option too, especially if your hands get sweaty, but I’ve kept this one bare for easier cleaning. </p>\n<p>So overall, ASUS has absolutely delivered on what they promised — an ultra-lightweight, esports-focused mouse with simple, no-nonsense software. But here’s the question: does shaving a few extra grams off really justify the premium price tag of 250 dollars? That’s something you’ll have to decide for yourself. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/10/gallery/asus-g03-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>For me, now that I’m used to the weight, it feels fantastic in the hand and it does exactly what it says on the tin, but it's not going to replace my multi button workhorse for daily usage.

In this review, I’ll walk you through the ordering process, customization options, setup experience, and what it’s been like using them. </p>\n<p>Weffort offers a lot of options to choose from, like, drapery, outdoor shades, and a wide variety of indoor styles. You can choose from classic roller shades, light-filtering sheers, zebra shades, or go for the elegant look of roman and cellular designs. For those who want flexibility, they also offer dual shades that combine different blackout levels to suit changing needs throughout the day. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"694\" height=\"389\" style=\"width: 694px; height: 389px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWpxcxH2fRQ\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The ordering process is straightforward but offers a huge amount of flexibility. What really caught our attention was how fast everything was done, especially considering these are fully customised blinds. We placed the order and within just three days, they were already shipped. Two days after that, the box was at our doorstep. Five days total for made-to-measure shades is honestly impressive and not something we expected. </p>\n<p>For our setup, we went with the Bouvardia Blackout series in Light Grey, mounted outside the window frame. Each shade was custom sized to 145 cm wide by 230 cm high. For our particular case we decided to instal two shades per window, giving us a bit more flexibility in general.</p>\n<p>We chose the cassette valance with matching fabric for a cleaner, integrated look, paired with the standard bottom rod. The blinds are powered by a battery motor, which is great for avoiding visible wiring, and we chose to have the motor with solar panels on the right-hand side for all blinds. However, after installing the panels, we did regret the placement and came up with a solution on how to move them to a more convenient place.  </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g01-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Since the cable is relatively short, it’s important to think carefully about where the motor will be placed as it also houses the charging and power port. In our case, one set of blinds is installed over balcony doors, so we ordered an extension cable for one of the solar panels. With that in place, we were able to position the panel neatly at the far end, where it’s out of the way and protected from accidental damage.  </p>\n<p>The solar panel’s effectiveness really comes down to how much direct sunlight your window receives. These windows get very little direct sun throughout the day, so there’s a gradual discharge. That said, the panel provides just enough trickle charge to stretch the battery life to about three or four months, which, all things considered, I’m perfectly happy with. </p>\n<p>To hide the panels, we set our blinds to stop at about 20 cm from the top. Even though I do like the clean look of fully retracted blinds, but with the solar option, I think this small adjustment improves the overall neatness. </p>\n<p>If you’re managing multiple blinds and shades throughout your home and wish to operate them either individually or collectively using a tangible device, you can choose to get 5 or 15-channel remote control. We love all things smart, so this remote control is going to be as a back up only. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g02-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>We use Zigbee, but Weffort supports a wide range of smart ecosystems. And while the pairing process was far from seamless (it took close to an hour and countless presses of the pairing button to get all four shades connected) once set up, they worked reliably and responded quickly to both remote and automation commands. </p>\n<p>In terms of performance, the noise levels are reasonable for a living room space. When testing just one blind, it comes up at around 49 dBA, while all four together register at around 53 dBA from a metre away. Lowering our 230 cm shades takes around 34 seconds, which feels like a good balance between speed and noise levels.  </p>\n<p>There’s also a hidden trick to fine-tune how fast the blinds move. By popping off the battery cover on the remote and pressing the small “P” button underneath, you unlock a speed adjustment mode. From there, pressing the up or down arrows changes the speed setting. With the motor giving feedback through a series of quick jogs: one jog confirms the press, two jogs mean medium speed, and three jogs signal full speed ahead. We cranked ours up to the maximum, which brought the open-or-close time down to just 30 seconds. </p>\n<p>One limitation is that the blinds do not stop automatically if there is an obstacle in the way. This could potentially damage the fabric or motor if something blocks the path.  </p>\n<p>At one point we did notice that one of the blinds developed a strange noise during operation, so we contacted Weffort’s customer support team for assistance, and they were quick to jump in and solve the issue. Luckily the fix was pretty simple - we just took the shade down, opened it up, and reassembled it. It involved removing three screws and took no more than ten minutes. After that, the noise disappeared completely. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/11/gallery/weffort-g03-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Let’s talk a bit more in detail about automation. In our example, we want the blind to come down whenever the lights are on to provide privacy and stay down during the night. If it’s before 6 PM, once the light is off, the blind opens up. After 6 PM, if the blind is down and the light is off, it will stay closed until the morning. For the morning routine we are utilising the sensors in the kitchen. To have them open up automagically but never waking us up too early, the automation is set for any time after 8am, if the blinds are down and there is movement in the kitchen, all the blinds will be triggered to open.  This routine has become seamless, and it’s one of those quality-of-life improvements you quickly get used to. </p>\n<p>It’s been also very useful on weekends when we decide to binge-watch TV shows during the day. With a single button press, our automation sets the lights, adjusts the AC, and now lowers the blinds to create our ideal viewing environment. </p>\n<p>Overall, these blackout roller shades delivered exactly what we were hoping for: a precise, custom fit; excellent privacy performance; and seamless integration with our smart home setup. While the pairing process could be smoother, and obstacle detection would be a welcome addition, the overall experience has been very positive. They look fantastic, work reliably, and make the living room feel more private and functional without any daily effort on our part.</p>",

Better than I expected. But there are caveats. Since the screen moves with your head, reading small text or playing detail-heavy games takes a bit of getting used to. </p>\n<p>The real strength here is flexibility. It’s not trying to replace your TV, it’s simple, versatile add-on for people who want a personal screen anywhere. </p>\n<p>And since it’s just a screen with no internal OS, no battery to degrade, it won’t age the same way as other gadgets. It’s something you can keep using creatively over time. </p>\n<p>It’s not essential. But it is genuinely fun, well-built, and way more useful than I initially thought. You just need to find your use case, and I’m willing to bet there are plenty more we haven’t even considered yet. </p>\n<p>Now let’s walk through what’s in the box, how it works, and all the pros and quirks I found along the way. </p>\n<p>Inside the main box, you’ll find the GOOVIS unit, a USB-C to USB-C cable, a cleaning cloth, and a quick start guide. The HDMI adapter is straightforward and doesn’t need much explanation. As for the Android TV dongle, it includes a sleek magnetic power bank (which is not needed if you’re powering it via cable) and a remote control, though, as usual, you’ll need to supply your own batteries. </p>\n<p>We also received their Zero Pressure Headband, which turned out to be one of the best upgrades. It is not a part of the standard kit, but I’ll talk about it more in a bit.  </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-12.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-13.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-13-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-14.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g01-14-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The headset is compact and feels light enough to wear comfortably, especially given how much tech is packed inside. Setup is just as straightforward — plug it into a phone that supports USB-C and it instantly turns into your screen. </p>\n<p>Adjustment-wise, it has independent per-eye myopia dials with satisfying clicky steps, and a lockable IPD slider. It’s great to see support for glasses too, you can either leave them on or fine-tune the optics to match your vision. </p>\n<p>But a few things could improve. I was disappointed to see that there is no built-in test pattern to help you dial it in. I would also love a lock for diopter adjustments or even some presets. These are not dealbreakers or anything, just things I would love to see added. </p>\n<p>Comfort-wise, the unit feels well-balanced thanks to its lightweight design. Since it doesn’t rest directly on your nose, it stays comfortable even during longer sessions. I did find myself wishing it could sit a little closer to the eyes to make the screen feel larger. The only workaround was to tilt it down slightly, but that puts some strain on your neck over time. </p>\n<p>Then we tested the Zero Pressure Headband and surprisingly it makes a huge difference. It secures with a twist knob at the back, centres automatically, and spreads the weight more evenly across your head. The original strap isn’t bad, but once you try the Zero Pressure one, it feels like this should be the standard. </p>\n<p>The strap comes with two padding options: anti-slip silicone and leather. Both work well, even in hot and sweaty Singapore, though I slightly prefer the leather for long sessions. You can remove and wash the face pad. I don’t recommend machine washing it, but it’s nice to have that option for hygiene. </p>\n<p>And before we talk about visuals, let me warn you about one important thing that should not have been left for the very last page of the manual - don’t plug any power into the headset’s USB ports, this could easily damage the unit. Ok – visuals! This screen is shockingly sharp. There are no visible pixels, and colours look fantastic. It’s plenty bright for indoor use and doesn’t blast your face with heat either. </p>\n<p>That said, there’s a learning curve. If the screens aren’t perfectly aligned with your eyes, the image can skew, or parts may look off. I wish there was an indicator to tell if it’s “straight” on your head, at the moment you just sort of feel it out. But once you zone in, especially when watching video, you get used to the situation and it just feels like a screen floating in space. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g02-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Audio-wise, the built-in speakers are fine. If you care about sound quality, use Bluetooth or try plugging headphones in. Though I should mention, I couldn’t get USB-C audio to work, but the 3.5mm audio on the side works well. </p>\n<p>I also tried this out for gaming. On PC, I tried Civilization VI by using the HDMI dongle. It was easy to set up as a second screen, and while it’s only 1080p, the clarity is solid. Diopter adjustments again helped sharpen the text. I would say closing one eye and fine-tuning works best here. </p>\n<p>However, games that involve a lot of reading can be a challenge. Since the display moves with your head, you have to hold incredibly still, almost like a sniper, just to read through blocks of text without everything shifting. It’s not impossible, but definitely not ideal for strategy games or dialogue-heavy RPGs. Visibility at the edges is also more limited. It feels a bit like looking into a box where the centre is clear, but you have to shift your head to catch what’s in the corners. To be clear, this isn’t a fault of the screen quality, it’s more about the field of view and how the image follows your movement. </p>\n<p>Now let’s focus on mobile gaming, which is where the GOOVIS really shines. I tested Asphalt 9 with an Xbox controller, and the experience was brilliant. It felt like having a full console strapped to my face, it was smooth, immersive, and fun. For me, this is the ideal use case: gaming while travelling or relaxing on the couch with something like a Steam Deck or ROG Ally. Just stick to action games, not text-heavy ones. </p>\n<p>The included Android dongle is surprisingly capable. It draws power via HDMI, no extra cables needed, and sets up quickly via your phone. It comes pre-installed with Prime, Disney+, and YouTube. Once set up, this feels like a personal cinema. The sound was actually louder here than when connected to my phone, and Google Assistant support is built in, though voice commands might feel odd if you’re on the move. </p>\n<p>There are many other use cases for this too!  I also tried using the GOOVIS during video calls while writing on my laptop. It’s entirely possible to have a video playing on the headset while working on your main screen. You’ll definitely look like a cyborg doing it, so maybe not something for the coffee shop just yet… but honestly, we’re not that far off. </p>\n<p>Now one of the most unexpectedly useful scenarios I tested was using it as a monitor for my video camera. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/12/gallery/goovis-g03-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Here’s the setup: camera HDMI out → into the HDMI dongle → and then into the GOOVIS. The dongle does need power, but a small power bank solves that. What you end up with is a massive, crisp screen right in front of your eyes — perfect for framing, monitoring focus, and adjusting settings — while still being able to see your surroundings. You’re not blocked off like in a VR headset, so you’re not going to trip over a light stand. </p>\n<p>This is so much easier than rigging up a chunky field monitor, dealing with mounting arms and cables, especially if you’re moving around. The same concept could easily apply to drone work as well, giving you a large, immersive screen while still allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings. Honestly, this use case alone might sell it to creators or field operators who need a portable, immersive, and clear monitor solution. </p>\n<p>And again, because the GOOVIS Art is just a display with no internal OS or battery, this isn’t a device that’s going to “age out” of relevance. If you find a solid niche for it, chances are it’ll stay useful for years to come. </p>\n<p>The image quality is fantastic, comfort is decent with a clear upgrade path via the zero-pressure strap, and the number of things you can do with it is surprisingly broad — from watching movies in bed to gaming on a flight or even using it as a portable camera monitor. </p>\n<p>It’s not trying to replace your TV or your VR headset. Instead it squeezes into a unique space, giving you a high-quality screen, wherever you want it, without being completely cut off from the world. </p>\n<p>It has its quirks, particularly with text readability and optical adjustments, but overall it performed better than I initially thought. I went in curious and came out genuinely impressed. </p>\n<p>If you’re a frequent traveller, a content creator, or just someone who wants a personal cinema experience without taking over the living room, this might just be worth a closer look. </p>\n<p>Let us know in the comments what your use case would be. Would you take it on a plane? Use it for gaming on the go? Or maybe have it as your new field monitor setup?</p>",

From layout quirks to thermal behaviour, here’s how the PA401 performs once you start working with it. </p>\n<p>Starting with the build experience itself. It was relatively smooth, but there are some quirks worth pointing out. </p>\n<p>The motherboard tray includes a captive standoff in the middle, which helps guide the board into place. That’s a simple touch that makes a noticeable difference, especially when installing the board vertically. However, there's no GPU support bracket included, which feels like a bit of a miss for a case in this price point, especially one that supports vertical GPU mounting. </p>\n<p>The side panel design is nice in terms of usability. It's tool-less and locks securely, but once removed, you really notice how compact this case is - it’s not built with bulky GPUs or massive coolers in mind. There's very little flex, which is great for build quality, but that compactness does come with trade-offs, especially in terms of component fit. </p>\n<p>The cable cut-outs don’t have rubber grommets, but they’re well-sized and smooth enough that you won’t need to worry about damaging cables during the build. That said, the lack of grommets does take away a bit of that clean, polished look you'd expect from something in the ProArt line-up. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-12.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-13.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-13-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-14.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-14-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-15.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g01-15-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>If you’re routing your GPU cables through the lower cut-out, I’d recommend planning ahead. Ideally, deal with those cables before fully installing the PSU. If you've already got the power supply in, you'll want to undo the two mounting screws, slide it back slightly, and then route your cables before locking it in place. It's doable, but tight.</p>\n<p>One of the high points for me was cable management. The included velcro straps are massive, like hilariously oversized in the best way, and they do a great job at keeping everything in place. There are also a lot of tie-down points on the back, which can help keep things neat. You can actually get a clean finish without much effort, which I always appreciate. </p>\n<p>Fan and radiator installation? That is mostly painless. The top bracket can be removed completely, which makes installing a radiator or fans up there significantly easier. But remember, 240mm is your max here. No 280 or 360s. This again brings us back to the limitations of the form factor. </p>\n<p>One last aesthetic point I want to mention is about the wood accents. I really like the idea, and I get what ASUS was going for, but I think they could’ve leaned into it more. The current implementation is so subtle that it looks like fake wood at first glance, especially under indoor lighting. If you’re going to call it a “Wood Edition,” then let that natural material shine a bit more. </p>\n<p>With the system up and running, it was time to put the ProArt PA401 through its paces to see how it handles thermals and acoustics. </p>\n<p>Let's start with the 100% fan speed mode first.  </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g02-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g02-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g02-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g02-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g02-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g02-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The CPU peaked at 54 degrees Celsius, and the GPU reached 53 degrees. These temperatures are fairly typical for a case of this size with a more compact airflow layout. The larger front intake fans clearly help keep the system cool while staying quiet, but we're beginning to bump into limitations when it comes to high-end hardware. The fans on this case run much slower than recently reviewed Lancool 217 from Lian Li which also makes them run significantly quieter. </p>\n<p>Switching to 40 dBa fan mode paints a slightly different picture. The CPU temperature increased to 55 degrees, while the GPU saw a 5-degree increase, landing at 58 degrees. This places the PA401 solidly in the middle of the stack. The thick 160 mm front fans are doing a lot of the heavy lifting, but it would be nice to have a few extra fans in there to push the hot air out.  </p>\n<p>Compared to the Lian Li 217, which peaked around 51 to 52 dBa, the ASUS lands in a nice sweet spot, especially at full fan speed, which makes sense given the inclusion of that fan selector switch. I’d actually make use of it, probably setting it to the quieter 40 dBa mode by default and toggling to full speed only when extra cooling is needed. </p>\n<p>In both scenarios, the case performed close to other compact mid-tower designs we've tested, especially those with similar cooling constraints. It's not a thermal powerhouse, but it holds its own, particularly for users prioritising a clean and quiet desk setup over squeezing in some power-hungry components. </p>\n<p>Now to sum it all up: it’s a case that delivers on its promises for the right type of user. If you’re a creator, designer, or someone who values a clean aesthetic and a quieter workspace, this could be a great fit. The build quality is solid, cable management is genuinely impressive, and features like the fan mode toggle and power button lock show that ASUS has put thought into real-world use cases. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/13/gallery/asus-g03-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Of course, it’s not for everyone.

Let’s get into it! </p>\n<p>The RX 9060 XT is based on AMD’s RDNA 4 architecture, built using TSMC’s 4nm process node. It features 32 Compute Units, 32 Ray Tracing Accelerators, and 64 AI Accelerators. AMD rates it for up to 821 TOPS of peak AI performance using INT4 Sparse operations, alongside a 3.1 GHz boost clock. </p>\n<p>You can choose between 8GB or 16GB of GDDR6 memory on a 128-bit bus. The 16GB model is priced at $349 USD, while the 8GB version comes in at $299. That makes it one of the more affordable GPUs with such a large memory pool. </p>\n<p>Power draw is modest, ranging from 150W to 180W depending on the configuration. Many board partners (including PowerColor) manage this with just a single 8-pin connector, making it an easy drop-in upgrade for older systems. PowerColor recommends at least a 500W power supply for the whole system. </p>\n<p>Connectivity includes PCIe 5.0 x16, though realistically, the performance class of this card doesn’t require that much bandwidth. An x8 interface might’ve actually made more sense, freeing up extra lanes for secondary GPUs or other expansion cards. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-12.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g01-12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Display outputs include two DisplayPort 2.1a and one HDMI 2.1b. While it’s nice to see modern display support, some might complain that AMD cut out the 4th output. Realistically though, for a card in this class, three is more than enough, most users will only ever use one or two displays anyway. </p>\n<p>There’s also a new media engine with full support for AV1, HEVC (H.265), and H.264 encoding and decoding. Plus, AMD has baked in a range of AI-powered features from upscaling to frame generation. How effective those are will depend on your workload, but it’s good to see them included. </p>\n<p>Now let’s talk about the card we’re using: this is the PowerColor RX 9060 XT Reaper. It features a stealthy all-black shroud with double-fan cooling, a full-length metal backplate, single 8-pin power connector, and zero-RPM fan mode for silent idle operation. The cooler is compact, fitting nicely in most cases, and should offer the thermal headroom needed for the 180W spec. So let's get into that but heads up – this video is not intended to cover every game. The focus is specifically on the performance of this card and how well its cooler handles the load. </p>\n<p>Right off the bat, in a long Time Spy Extreme loop, the RX 9060 XT pulls on average just over 160W, which is impressively close to the RX 7600 we tested previously. But where the 7600 averages 32 FPS, this card delivers 46 FPS, putting it slightly behind the RX 7700 XT which comes in around 49 FPS. </p>\n<p>Compared to AMD’s 9070 XT from earlier in the year (which nearly doubles the performance at 91 FPS) the 9060 XT clearly belongs in a different tier, but the power draw difference between them is far more dramatic. It’s less than half the wattage, making it interesting from an efficiency standpoint. </p>\n<p>When combining both FPS and power figures, we can look at performance-per-watt - and the RX 9060 XT ranks well here. It’s considerably more efficient than previous-gen cards like the RX 6700 XT or RTX 3080, but it still doesn’t match the surprising efficiency of the 9070, which remains an outlier in AMD’s stack. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-12.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-13.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-13-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-14.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/14/gallery/powercolor-g02-14-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Now let’s talk thermals. With the stock fan curve, fan speed tops out at around 52–53%. The GPU itself stays stable at about 70°C, the hotspot hovers at 90°C, and memory sits in the 85–87°C range. These figures might seem high at first glance, but they’re absolutely within spec for modern GPUs. If you prefer cooler temps, manually setting fan speed to 80% drops all those values by roughly 10°C. Maxing out the fans reduces temps even further but it’s at the cost of unbearable noise. </p>\n<p>Which leads us to acoustics. This card isn’t massively powerful, but that actually works in its favour. Even with its small cooler and dual fans, it stays whisper quiet, it’s below our room noise floor of 37.9 dBA in stock configuration. I couldn’t detect any coil whine either, even with my ear right next to the testbench. Bumping fan speed to 80% raises noise to around 46 dBA, 90% gives 48.3 dBA, and 100% hits 52.2 dBA. Personally, I’d keep it at stock or tweak it slightly toward 80% for a good balance. </p>\n<p>Which brings us to the conclusion. The RX 9060 XT isn’t a powerhouse, but it nails efficiency, thermals, and acoustics. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought it was too small and too light to handle the heat, but I was wrong. This card could be a fantastic fit for a compact, small form factor build. What do you guys think - does this belong in your next ITX build, or would you skip it? Let us know in the comments.</p>",

Impressive. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"390\" style=\"width: 696px; height: 390px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MwtjZrgh0Y\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h3>Design &amp; Aesthetic Details</h3>\n<p>The Lancool 217 sets itself apart with minimalist wood inserts that flank the front panel — available in walnut (black version) or oak (white version). Rather than turning the chassis into a full “wooden case,” these trims are tasteful and subtle, giving the case a warm, modern aesthetic without sacrificing neutrality. </p>\n<p>Ventilation is a clear design priority. The top, front, and bottom are all heavily meshed, including a fine bottom dust filter for the PSU. The top mesh isn’t designed to be removed regularly, but it’s still easy to clean. The front panel is held in place with magnets, making access tool-free and smooth — a small, premium-feeling touch. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Pre-Installed Cooling &amp; Airflow Options</h3>\n<p>Where the Lancool 217 really starts to shine is in cooling. Out of the box, you get: </p>\n<p>* 2x 170 mm x 30 mm front intake fans</p>\n<p>* 2x 140 mm inverted-blade bottom intake fans</p>\n<p>* 1x 140 mm rear exhaust fan</p>\n<p>That’s five high-performance fans included, and the two bottom fans are tool-less and repositionable. They mount via rubber grommets and can be moved between two preset positions: above or below the PSU shroud. This is especially handy if you're planning a vertical GPU mount (which is supported with an included bracket, though the riser cable is sold separately). </p>\n<p>Lian Li also includes extra brackets and filters if you prefer to replace the front fans with standard 120 mm or 140 mm models, but honestly, the stock 170 mm units already deliver exceptional airflow with relatively low noise. </p>\n<p>Radiator support is limited to the top of the case, but the clearances are decent: </p>\n<p>* Up to 60 mm total thickness for 280 mm radiators</p>\n<p>* Up to 83 mm total thickness for 360 mm radiators</p>\n<p>For standard component clearances: </p>\n<p>* GPU length: up to 380 mm</p>\n<p>* GPU height: up to 182 mm</p>\n<p>* CPU cooler height: up to 180 mm</p>\n<p>* PSU length: up to 220 mm</p>\n<p>This is more than enough for most enthusiast builds, although users with bulky dual-tower air coolers should double-check headroom if using top-mounted fans. </p>\n<div

in the Lancool 217 is a genuinely pleasant experience thanks to thoughtful design throughout. The removable bottom fans make connecting front panel headers or USB cables far easier than usual. All I/O cables come pre-grouped into a single block, which simplifies routing. And the fan/RGB hub offers generous cable length, making it easy to reach headers no matter where your motherboard connectors are. </p>\n<p>That said, not everything is perfect. The bottom cable grommet is tight — wide cable bundles won’t fit easily, so you may need to route cables one at a time. The power button is tucked under the mesh and partially obscured by internal cabling, which makes emergency shutdowns less convenient. </p>\n<p>Cable management is generally solid. Three pre-installed Velcro straps behind the motherboard tray help keep things neat, even when mounting the PSU sideways (which can cause the cables to protrude slightly, though the panel still closes without issue). </p>\n<p>Swapping between default and CPU-focused fan layouts takes only a few minutes — and that flexibility is something we appreciate. Just be cautious with the blanking plates; they’re a bit of a pain to remove. Use a flathead screwdriver to avoid sore fingers. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure

Acoustics</h3>\n<p>To evaluate thermal performance, we ran tests in both default and CPU-focused fan configurations. </p>\n<p>At 100% fan speed, the Lancool 217 became the loudest case we’ve ever tested, hitting over 52 dBA. But it earned that noise level — especially on the GPU side. Even with the fans reconfigured to prioritise CPU cooling, CPU thermals barely improved, while GPU temps spiked by nearly 4 °C. </p>\n<p>In noise-normalised testing at 40 dBA, both fan modes delivered identical CPU results, but the stock fan configuration clearly dominated overall, offering the best thermal balance in our charts. The 170 mm fans at the front — combined with the bottom intakes — provide outstanding airflow across the entire system. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/15/gallery/lian-g03-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n<p>The black version of the Lancool 217 (with walnut trim) is priced at $120 USD, while the white version (featuring oak wood accents) comes in at $125 USD. Given the airflow design, flexibility, and bundled fan setup, this is a competitive price point in the mid-tower market. </p>\n<h3>Final Verdict</h3>\n<p>The Lancool 217 doesn’t shout “premium” at first, but once you start building and testing, it earns your respect. Excellent airflow, smart modularity, and a clean visual design all come together to make a case that feels far more refined than its $120 USD price tag would suggest. </p>\n<p>If you’re after a mid-tower that’s easy to work with, performs well, and ditches the RGB in favour of natural materials and quiet confidence — this one is worth your attention.</p>",

It delivers cutting-edge performance in nearly every category, though it left us wishing for just one thing: a bigger version.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"390\" style=\"width: 696px; height: 390px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5HXp8qK92I\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>In this article, we’re taking a closer look at its standout features, performance in real-world use, and a few important quirks to be aware of.</p>\n<h3>Display and Core Specifications</h3>\n<p>The PG27UCDM features a 27-inch 4K OLED display with a pixel density of 166 pixels per inch. It uses the latest 4th generation QD-OLED panel, paired with a 240Hz refresh rate for top-tier motion clarity. It supports DisplayPort 2.1a and is UHBR20 certified, allowing for up to 80 Gbps bandwidth — enough to push 4K at 240Hz without compression.</p>\n<p>However, there is a catch. As of 2025, only NVIDIA’s 5000-series GPUs support the full UHBR20 bandwidth. AMD’s current generation tops out at 54 Gbps, meaning you’ll need compression like DSC to hit similar resolutions and refresh rates.</p>\n<h3>Build and Design</h3>\n<p>The monitor features slim bezels and a clean overall aesthetic, though the stand design may not be to everyone's taste. ASUS continues to use a tripod-style base, which limits how far back the monitor can sit on a desk. This may be a concern for those who prefer a minimalist layout or need to maximise desk space.</p>\n<p>One design choice we do appreciate is that the VESA mount is entirely separate from the stand. Rather than having to remove a mounting plate from the stand itself, the monitor includes a dedicated VESA attachment on the back. This makes it quick and easy to switch between the included stand and a monitor arm or wall mount. While this flexibility will only matter to a subset of users, it’s a thoughtful inclusion.</p>\n<h3>Silent Operation</h3>\n<p>A standout feature is the passive cooling system. The PG27UCDM runs completely silent with no internal fan, even under load. For an OLED panel pushing this level of performance, that’s impressive. It eliminates the risk of fan noise or coil whine, which is a major advantage for quiet workspaces or content creation environments.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-12.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g01-12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Connectivity</h3>\n<p>Port selection is generous. It includes DisplayPort 2.1, two HDMI 2.1 ports, and a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alt Mode and up to 90W of power delivery — useful for charging laptops or powering accessories. There is also a 3.5mm headphone jack and a USB hub connected via an uplink cable, offering three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports.</p>\n<h3>No Built-in Speakers</h3>\n<p>There are no built-in speakers, which we actually see as a positive. If you are buying a thousand-dollar monitor, you can probably afford a good set of external speakers or a quality pair of headphones.</p>\n<h3>Stand Adjustability and Lighting</h3>\n<p>The included stand supports height, tilt, swivel, and pivot adjustments. There’s also a projection light underneath that adds some gamer-style flair. While it may appeal to some, we found it a bit distracting in practice.</p>\n<h3> OLED Panel Performance</h3>\n<p>The display itself is where the PG27UCDM truly shines. Thanks to the QD-OLED technology, the screen delivers exceptional contrast, vibrant colours, and deep blacks, especially in dark game scenes. The high contrast gives an overall impression of brightness, even if the actual luminance levels aren’t extreme by LCD standards.</p>\n<p>Colour accuracy is also excellent straight out of the box. It covers 99% of the DCI-P3 colour space, and exceeds 100% of both sRGB and AdobeRGB, making it suitable for creative workflows including photo editing and colour grading.</p>\n<p>HDR performance includes support for HDR10, Dolby Vision, and DisplayHDR True Black 400. Unlike some panels that overdo saturation or crush detail in shadows, this one handles tone mapping well. A Uniform Brightness mode helps maintain consistent luminance, which is useful in colour-critical work or general desktop use.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-12.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g02-12-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Usability Features</h3>\n<p>ASUS includes a few smart features to improve day-to-day usability. One of the best is the proximity sensor. Unlike previous versions we’ve tested, this one is well-executed. It allows you to automatically turn off the display when you walk away and wake it back up as you return. The detection range is adjustable between 60 and 120 cm, and it can even learn your typical seating position.</p>\n<p>This is especially handy if the monitor is used as a secondary display on a different desk or in setups where the screen isn’t always in direct use.</p>\n<h3>Gaming Tools</h3>\n<p>The PG27UCDM includes several gaming-focused features such as crosshairs, an on-screen timer, FPS counter, and display overlays. One standout is *Sniper Zoom*, which adds a central magnification window that zooms in between 1.2x and 2x. While it might not see daily use, it could offer a subtle edge in competitive shooters.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s a useful tool or an unfair advantage is up for debate — but it’s a unique option nonetheless.</p>\n<h3>Our Only Major Complaint: Size</h3>\n<p>Our biggest issue with the PG27UCDM is the size. While 27 inches is fine for competitive gaming or limited desk space, the visual quality of this display feels like it deserves a larger canvas. A 32-inch version would offer a more immersive experience for both gaming and creative work, without sacrificing much in terms of sharpness or pixel density. At 27 inches, it feels slightly constrained, especially if you’re sitting further back from the screen.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-02.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-03.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-04.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-05.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-06.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-07.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-08.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-11.jpg\" data-size=\"1024x576\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://a2kmedia.net/media/posts/16/gallery/rog-g03-11-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>The ASUS ROG Swift PG27UCDM is one of the most impressive gaming monitors we’ve tested. From visual performance to responsiveness and feature set, it delivers at nearly every level. ASUS has also taken OLED burn-in seriously with features like proximity sensing and Uniform Brightness.</p>\n<p>That said, it’s not perfect. The stand takes up more space than it should, and the 27-inch form factor limits its impact somewhat. But if you're looking for top-tier image quality and cutting-edge performance in a compact form, this monitor is very hard to beat. </p>",
